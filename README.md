# Horiseon-Online-Marketing-Website

This project, which I named Horiseon-Online-Marketing-Website, is part of the 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with refractoring the existing code (improving it without changing what it does) in order to meet accessibility standards. I'll be adding semantic HTML elements that follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning, ensuring heading attributes fall in sequential order, add alt attributes to any image elements, and add a more descriptive title element.

The website I will be working on is for a company named Horiseon. Horiseon is an online marketing company that provides Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.
